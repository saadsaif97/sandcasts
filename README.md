```
config variables in laravel are like the global variables and are cached by laravel,
Using environment variable directly will slowdown our project because project always
go to environment to get that variable, so you have to fetch the environment variable
using the config variables, because it will be stored in the cache by the laravel and
you speed will not slow down
